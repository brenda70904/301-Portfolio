I had been working as a preschool lead teacher for years and later on decided to switch my career path to software development.üë©üèª‚ÄçüíªÔ∏è I really enjoy solving problems and I am always interested in tech since I was a kid. I started teaching myself coding with Java couple of months ago and I am recently learning JS,React and Bootstrap because I want to be able to build a website myself as a professional full-stack developer. I hope one day I can use my technical and problem-solving skills to make positive contributions to my community, to help educate children, or to make contributions to open sources. üíú",
